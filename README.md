# Dotix - Defense of the Pixels

I'm trying to clone Dota on browser. [Demo](https://dotix.vercel.app/)

## Installation

1. Clone the project: `gh repo clone sangdth/dotix`.
2. Install dependencies and start:
```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```
3. You should have dev server running at `localhost:3000`.

## Tech stacks:
* Bundling by [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).
* Views built on [Pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js) with helps from [React-Pixi](https://github.com/inlet/react-pixi).
* Physics with [matter-js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js).
* React, TypeScript, ESlint, etc.

## Help!
